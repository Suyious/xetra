## xetra
#### xetra is an online shopping website concept built with nextjs and nodejs.

xetra is a personal project I started working on quite a while ago and it really helped me get better at frontend as well as backend. The implementations of backend required me to get deeper into nodejs and the frontend required to me to get more creative with the components needed for the project. I have not used any third party front-end framework for this project as I was aiming to brush up my own implementation skills.
